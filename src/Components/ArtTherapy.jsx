          <h2 className="art-therapy-question">What is Art Therapy?</h2>
          <p className="art-therapy-answer">
            Art Therapy is a unique therapeutic approach that uses the creative process of making art to help individuals explore emotions, relieve stress, and gain personal insight. Unlike traditional talk therapy, art therapy enables self-expression and self-discovery through visual means, making it an effective tool for personal growth, healing, and clarity.
